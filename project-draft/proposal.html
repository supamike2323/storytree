            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>
                Stories serve as an outlet for people's creativity and allow for the expression of infinitely many ideas. As society, a multitude of literature has been based and continued off of another work. However, there needs to be a dedicated platform that allows people to contribute to a single narrative, explore different story paths, and create a dynamic experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current lack of a platform for collaborative story writing limits the creative potential of users who wish to co-author stories. Existing platforms may not provide the necessary features for version control, which allows for branching story paths, or user interaction in the context of collaborative storytelling via commenting.
            </p>
            <p>
                While there are platforms like 1) <a href="https://plotfactory.com/" target="_blank">Plot Factory</a>which are used more for planning, none seem to specifically cater to collaborative storytelling with features like story branching, and user interaction. Platforms like that may not offer the tailored experience needed for a collaborative storytelling environment. 2) <a href="https://www.authorea.com" target="_blank">Authorea</a>, a collaborative platform to read, write, and publish research. Itprovides a space for scientific document edit. It allows users for comments and annotations in order to have the flexibility and connection with other users.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>
                Our proposed web application is a collaborative story-writingplatform where aspiring writers can collectively contributeto the creation of stories without regard for academic oreconomic hurdles. We will provide a collaborative storty space where we initially provide some stories beginnings generate by us, and thenusers can click on different stories and access a text box to continue writingthe story. They can also create their own creative story for others to continue writing.As an online platform, we should be designed to be as inclusive as possible and ensure a diverse andwelcoming environment for users from various backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                By having an online user profile, writers are characterized by their stories rather thanany other extraneous factors. While our primary users should be writerswho aim to contribute to stories, avid readers are welcome to join andenjoy the collaborative stories as well. Besides, the fans of existingstories or books would be our potential users, It provides them aplatform for them to share universes or alternative creative storylines with familiar settings.

            <h2>Solving the problem</h2>
            <p>
                While most of the exsisting platforms for online writing mostly feature ease of publication. Our solution ecnourages public collaboration of writing, giving the public more freedom to build off popular works and write their own versions of stories. It also allows for original authors who cannot continue a story due to other obligations to not let their ideas die and to take hold in the hands of others.
